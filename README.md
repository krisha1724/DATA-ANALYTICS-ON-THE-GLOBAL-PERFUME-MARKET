Perfume Pricing Analysis & Prediction Using Data Science
1. Introduction
The global perfume industry is a multi-billion-dollar market influenced by evolving consumer preferences, brand identity, pricing strategies, and scent trends. This project leverages data science techniques such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), trend identification, and predictive modeling to uncover patterns in the perfume market.

The dataset includes details like:

Brand

Perfume Name

Rating

Price (USD)

Gender Target

Bottle Size (ml)

Launch Year

Stock Quantity

Fragrance Notes

Using libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, we present actionable insights to guide business strategies in pricing, marketing, and inventory management.

2. Problem Definition & Dataset Selection
Problem Statement:
Businesses in the perfume industry face challenges in optimal pricing due to fluctuating trends, customer preferences, and inventory complexities. Misjudging these elements can lead to overstock, understock, or pricing inefficiencies.

This project aims to:

Examine key attributes affecting pricing, rating, and availability.

Predict ideal price points using data-driven methods.

Assist businesses in optimizing stock levels and pricing for better profitability.

3. Objectives
Understand Factors Influencing Perfume Prices

Analyze how brand, fragrance notes, bottle size, and gender affect pricing.

Determine key attributes that most strongly correlate with price.

Explore Consumer Preferences

Analyze the relationship between ratings, fragrance notes, and gender-based targeting.

Determine if higher-rated perfumes command higher prices or popularity.

Inventory and Demand Trends

Study stock quantity to identify in-demand perfumes and supply shortages.

Understand which brands/products frequently go out of stock.

Historical Launch Analysis

Investigate how launch year affects perfume popularity and pricing.

Determine whether older or newer perfumes are more expensive or sought after.

Feature Engineering

Create new features like Perfume Age = Current Year - Launch Year.

One-hot encode categorical variables (brand, gender, fragrance category).

Actionable Business Insights

Recommend pricing and stock strategies.

Identify products for discounting, promotions, or restocking.

Visualize Market Trends

Use graphs and charts (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for key findings.

Create visual dashboards and EDA plots.

Task 4: Data Visualization & Outlier Detection
Use:

Histograms

Box plots

Scatter plots

Correlation heatmaps

Detect outliers and anomalies

Task 5: Data Transformation & Feature Engineering
Encode categorical features

Create new derived attributes (e.g., perfume age)

Normalize numerical fields (if needed)

Task 6: Time Series & Trend Analysis (If Applicable)
Explore time-dependent trends using Launch Year vs Price, Rating, Stock

Identify seasonal patterns in perfume launches or stock availability

Visualize year-wise trends using line plots or bar graphs

6. Dataset Variable Types
Numerical: Price, Rating, Bottle Size, Stock Quantity, Launch Year

Categorical: Brand, Gender, Fragrance Notes, Fragrance Category

Target Variable: Price (USD)

7. Model Building (Next Phase – Optional)
Regression (Linear, Ridge, Lasso)

Decision Trees / Random Forest

Feature Importance Analysis

Model Evaluation (RMSE, R², MAE)

8. Key Findings (To Be Summarized After EDA & Modeling)
Correlation between rating and price

Gender-based pricing trends

Brands with frequent stockouts

Perfume age vs popularity/pricing

9. Ethical Considerations
Privacy & Anonymity: Ensure no personal consumer data is exposed.

Bias & Fairness: Avoid reinforcing gender stereotypes or brand favoritism in model output.

Data Integrity: Validate source credibility and correctness before drawing conclusions.

Transparency: Ensure business stakeholders understand the data limitations and assumptions.
